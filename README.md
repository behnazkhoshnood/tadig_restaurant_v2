## **UX (User Experience)** ##

### **Project Summary** ###

The main purpose of this project is to build a full-stack site based around business logic used to control a centrally-owned dataset.
By authenticating on the site and paying for some of its services, users can advance their own goals. Before authenticating, the site makes it clear how those goals would be furthered by the site.
The site owner is able to make money by providing this set of services to the users. There is no way for a regular user to bypass the site's mechanisms and derive all of the value available to paid users without paying.

### **Design choices**

  The goal in design was to create a website that is overall user friendly, has a modern feel with emphasis on providing information about the restaurant dishes/drinks in a readable and eye-catching way. Therefore, following design choices were made:
- **Framework**
  * Front-end framework, [Bootstrap](https://Bootstrap.com/),  based on bootstrap Design was chosen for this project for its modern interface and ease of use.

  * [JQuery](https://jquery.com/) was used for initializing some bootstrap elements.

- **Typography**
  - I used [Google Fonts](https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Lato&display=swap") for the font style of my project:
    - The font I have used for this project is called **Lato** and sans-serif as a backup font.

- **Icons**
  - I used [Favicon](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/patterns/favicon/) to make a unic brand for my website.
  - I used [FontAwesome]() as the main icon library across the project (e.g. for forms and buttons).

- **Colour Scheme**

  The idea of using different shades of the same colour is implemented accross the website. The primary colour used for main buttons and headings is deep purple as it seems to create a nice contrast with white backgrounds. The secondary colour used for icons, dividers and some other buttons is blue and pink.

  - **Main colour palette**

    - Main colors that have been used are black and white and some shades of gray due to their high contrast which complement the colorful images.
    - For toast messeges headers and some labels I used bootstrap scheme:
        - Succsess: #28a745; which is a shade of green color.
        - Danger: #dc3545 ; which is a shade of red color.
        - Primary: #007bff ; which is a shade of blue color.
        - secondary: #6c757d ; which is a shade of gray color.
        - warning: ##ffc107 ; which is a shade of yellow color.
        - info: #17a2b8 ; which is a shade of blue color.
        - light: #f8f9fa ; which is a shade of light gray color.
        - dark: #343a40 ; which is a shade of dark gray color.

  - I had some migration issues that have been fixed by deleting all migrations in all apps exept the __int__ and migrate them again.

- **Issue 5** 
  - Bag was showing the delivery fee even when nothing in shoping bag.
  - I fixed this issue adding this code:

        if (
            self.order_total < settings.FREE_DELIVERY_THRESHOLD and
            self.order_total != 0):
            self.delivery_cost = settings.STANDARD_DELIVERY_FEE
        else:
            self.delivery_cost = 0

- ** Known Issues **
  - the social icons for twiter and istagram is not shown in my index page!
  - the review rating form stoped working and just adds one star to my products after deleting the migrations.
  - stripe payment-intent-success gives error 500
  - in some views the toast notifications are blurry

## Deployment

### Steps to deploy Tadig to Heroku using Postgres

#### In Heroku:
1. Setup and account and log in to Heroku
2. On the apps page select `NEW`.
3. Give the app a name and select the closest region – then click `Create App`.
4. Click on Resources tab to provision a new Postgres database for it.
5. Search in the Addons search bar for `Heroku Postgres`.
6. Select your Development plan (in my case - Hobby Dev Plan).

#### In GitPod or IDE:
7. To use postgres open project in GitPod and install:
```
*   pip3 install django
*   pip3 install django-allauth
*   pip3 install pillow
*   pip3 install django-crispy-forms
*   pip3 install django-storages
*   pip3 install stripe
*   pip3 install dj_database_url
*   pip3 install psycopg2-binary
*   Update requirements: pip3 freeze > requirements.txt
```

#### In Django - setup new database:
In `Settings.py`:   

8. Make sure import os is there.
9. Add: `import dj_database_url`.
10. Goto Database settings and comment out existing database setting and add below example to point the database at the new Postgres database.
```
example:
    DATABASES = {
        'default': dj_database_url.parse( # ***paste in the database URL from Heroku***)
    }
```
11. Run Migrations. `Migrations have now been made to the Postgres Database.`
12. After a Successful Migration goto memberships.models.

---
***Important:***

13. Comment out the `post_save_create_memberships` signal - ***this is because creating a user will trigger this signal to create a free membership. 
But as there will be no packages setup within our new database - we must stop this signal before we create our superuser.***   
---
14. Now we can create a superuser -: `python3 manage.py createsuperuser`.
15. Runserver and login as superuser to the admin page.
16. Goto Packages in the memberships section.
17. Click add package to add each of the following 2 packages
*   package type: free.
*   package price: 0.
*   stripe plan id: (price_id) get this from your stripe - Products - Free Plan - Pricing - API id.   

***and***  
*   package type: premium.
*   package price: 5.
*   stripe plan id: (price_id) get this from your stripe - Products - Premium Plan - Pricing - API id.
18. Save and logout of admin.
19. Stop the server.
20. Uncomment the signal from step 13.
21. Restart the server and check admin - the superuser will now be linked to a free package type and have a stripe customer id.
22. Goto Settings -  Database settings - remove the Postgres database URL.
23.  Create an if/else code block to check if the os.environ variable is defined. 
if it is defined that will mean we are on Heroku so we will use the Postgres database.
Else we will be in our local environment and so use the default database.
```
    Example: 
    if 'DATABASE_URL' in os.environ:
        DATABASES = {
            'default': dj_database_url.parse(os.environ.get('DATABASE_URL'))
        }
    else:
        DATABASES = {
            'default': {
                'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.sqlite3',
                'NAME': os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'db.sqlite3'),
            }
        }
```

24. In the Terminal install gunicorn as our webserver: `pip3 install gunicorn`
25. Freeze requirements. `Pip3 freeze > requirements.txt`
26. Create a Procfile at the same level as the project. 
27. Enter the following code into the Procfile to tell Heroku to create a web dyno that will run gunicorn and serve tadig:
```
    web: gunicorn tadig-testaurant.wsgi:application
```
28. Temporarily disable collect static – to do this:
*   login via the terminal: heroku login –i.
*   Enter heroku email and password.
*   Enter the following in the terminal:
```
    heroku config:set DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC=1 --app mr-smyth-tadig-restaurant
```
In `Settings.py`:   

29. Add the hostname of the Heroku app – to ALLOWED_HOSTS (also include localhost):
```
    ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['tadig-restaurant.herokuapp.com', 'localhost'].
```
30. Ensure all .env variables such as the Django and stripe secret keys remain private. Also, make sure they are set up inside Heroku's config vars.

In `The Terminal`:

31. Deploy to Heroku:
*   Add and push to GitHub
*   git add .
*   git commit –m “**your-message**”
*   git push
*   Now initialize heroku git remote (because we created our app on the website rather than with the CLI): 
*       heroku git:remote -a mr-smyth-tadig-restaurant
*   Then push to heroku : git push heroku master

In `The Heroku`:

32. Setup automatic deployment in Heroku:
*   Goto the deploy tab
*   Set deployment method to GitHub
*   Search for tadig-restaurant
*   Click connect
*   Scroll down and click Enable Automatic Deploys

tadig-restaurant is now deployed to Heroku

## Local Deployment

**Before starting, some prerequisites:**

*   Before starting you should have an IDE set up - [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). - for example.
*   Its advisable to have a virtual environment setup. Pythons own can be used : 

```
    python3 -m .venv venv
    .venv\Scripts\activate
```

*   Have **at least** the following installed:   
    *   Python3 - to run the application.
    *   Pip - to install any requirements.
    *   GIT - required for version control.


The above example displays an env for a local purpose only.

5.  Install all requirements for the application by using this command:
```
    sudo -H pip3 -r requirements.txt
```
6.  In the IDE terminal, use the following command to start tadig-restaurant:
```
    python manage.py runserver
```

tadig-restaurant should now be running locally on localhost port 8000. (http://127.0.0.1:8000)

7.  After running Django initially, it will create the local database **db.SQLite3**.
8.  Make all migrations:
```
python3 manage.py makemigrations --dry-run
python3 manage.py makemigrations
python3 manage.py migrate --plan
python3 manage.py migrate
```

9.  Create a superuser:
```
python3 manage.py createsuperuser
***Enter username, email and password***
```

You should now have a local copy of tadig-restaurant.
